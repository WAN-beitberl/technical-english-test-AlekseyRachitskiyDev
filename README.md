In the process of studying the material, I got acquainted with a new language for myself.
I learned how to add packages, create components such as buttons, and understood what the language is for.
The language is essential for writing web applications and dynamic web pages.
Unfortunately, I could not test the code, because vs code and the web interpreter did not work correctly.
Despite my best efforts, I was unable to get the web page up, but I can explore all the links.
